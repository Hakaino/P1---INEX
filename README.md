# P1---INEX
Interplanetary Exploration Vehicle
This is part of project from the group C2-20 of the first semester of Robotics from the Aalborg University, we consider the possibility of building a vehicle that can autonumosly do research on a extraterrestrial planets surface.
As a substitute for the real bot, we are using a Turtlebot 2, to develop a software that can be used for maping and navigation.
